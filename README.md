![Project Banner or Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600.png?text=GoCart+Marketplace)

GoCart is a complete, feature-rich multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace built using the latest web technologies. It provides a seamless platform for customers to shop, sellers to manage their stores, and administrators to oversee the entire operation.

The application is designed with three distinct user roles in mind:
1.  **Customers:** Can browse products from various stores, manage their cart, place orders, and review products.
2.  **Sellers:** Can apply to open a store, and once approved by an admin, can add/manage products, view their sales dashboard, and fulfill orders.
3.  **Admins:** Have full control over the platform, including approving new stores, managing site-wide coupons, and viewing analytics.
